# Password-Generator

This project, which I named Password-Generator, is part of the 03 Javascript: Password generator Challenge for U.C. Berkeley Extension's Coding Boot Camp. My name is Eric Rothmuller and I am a student of the Boot Camp. In this project I was tasked with creating a functional password generator that uses window prompts to take in the user's inputs. The end result should be a  password generator that generates a random password based on a pool from the users selections.
